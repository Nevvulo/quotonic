# Quotonic
Advanced quote plugin for Powercord that uses screenshots to quote users and features instant replay

## âš  This plugin is no longer being maintained and may not work
**Some things may not work as intended, or not work at all**. If you find an issue, unfortunately I can't do much as I have stopped maintaining this project.

## Known issues
* Quoting a message with content and an attachment may cause the resulting screenshot to be cropped at the top slightly
* Quoting content near the bottom of the application window may cause the screenshot/message to become cut off
* Quoting large amounts of content (near 2000 characters) may not fit on the page and the resulting screenshot may be cut off or sized incorrectly

## Not a bug
* Quotes made with a zoom factor below 100% may look a little blurry - there is ultimately not a whole lot I can do about this because the elements themselves are actually smaller and therefore the resolution of the screenshot decreases

## Coming soon
* **Instant replay**! Provide two messages from two different time periods and you'll be able to see the messages in between play as if they were happening at that moment! Fasts forwards if a message hasn't been sent for a while.
* Settings to allow you to decide how big screenshots should be and where text should be cut off
* More options in the quote header
